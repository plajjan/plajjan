- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building a distributed programming language, [Acton](https://www.acton-lang.org/), besides also working on network automation stuff at Deutsche Telekom and Cisco.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to build a distributed programming language ;)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on building a distributed programming language. You ever wanted a fast high level language that natively and seamlessly works across multiple computers offering fault tolerance and immortal applications?
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with writing the Acton standard library! Unhappy with the batteries in Python? Dislike the Go choice of stdlib? Ever dreamt of Write an Acton library today! :)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about, or strike up a conversation, how we should all develop software natively for cloud environments using next generation distributed programming languages. I'm also quite proficient in YANG, Acton, network management and automation or distributed programming languages with orthogonal persistence
